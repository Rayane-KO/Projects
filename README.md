# Projects
Here you can find all the projects I made for my studies at the VUB (Computer Science)

## All my projects
### 1st bachelor
1. Fire-Ant  
This is the first game I had to make in my first year. The player controls an ant that needs to solve puzzles in a maze to progress. The player must also avoid the scorpions or he/she will lose a life. This game was made in Scheme/R5RS. The graphics library was given.

2. MicroBit  
For the second project we worked with the Raspberry Pi Zero (RPi). We had to make circuits with leds, buttons... and then use them to make mini-games. This project was made in Racket and the library with the functions for the RPi was given.

### 2nd bachelor
1. Checkers    
This project was made in groups of 2. We could choose the project, but it had to be done in Assembly 80386 TASM. This project also had to be defended.

2. Dr.Mario  
For this project we worked with an M5-Plus Stick. We used the language C to implement the game Dr.Mario. The device had buttons and an accelerometer, so we had to use these features to implement the game. For example: click on the button to rotate or tilt the device to move left/right.

3. Game Of Life  
This project was also made in C. It was not a difficult project. We had to add a feature so that the user can save the state of the cells in a txt-file and then load it using the command-line.

4. Project_HCI  
This project was made in groups of 3. It was not a programmingproject but a project where we had to design and make a new prototype for the website of the VUB, using the knowledge we have acquired during the lectures and exercises sessions.

5. Railway-System (not finished yet)  
This project was made in racket. We had to make a railway system (with a Grafical User Interface) so that users can control the railway. The user can move trains, detect trains on detectionblocks, change the position of switches... For the moment it should only work on a simulator, but later we will test it on a hardware railway.

6. SIAM  
SIAM is a 2-player game (Rhinos vs Elephants) where the players should push a rock off of the board. Either animal can push a rock, but if you want to push an animal facing you, you have to be superior in numbers. We also added spells that you can use on the other player. This project was made in an object-oriented programming style using Scala.

### 3rd bachelor
1. Parallellism
In this project, we had to implement a parallel search engine. By inputting a word, it could retrieve the articles in which that word occurred.
2. Distribution
For this project, we had to implement a complete distributed system where multiple users could add, remove, and update articles. Users are also able to retrieve articles. This system ensures data integrity and security.
3. ML_Project
For this machine learning project, we aimed to predict the power output of wind turbines based on given features. We began with exploratory data analysis and experimented with various models.
